# Custom Related List Component

## Overview
The Custom Related List component enhances Salesforce functionality by providing a dynamic interface for viewing and interacting with related object records directly from the Parent Object record page.

## Usage
### Step 1: Deployment
Deploy the Custom Related List component onto the record page of any Parent Object within Salesforce, such as "Account". This deployment enables users to access the component's functionality directly from the Parent Object's record page.

### Step 2: Object Selection
From the component interface, users can select the related object they wish to interact with from a picklist. This selection determines the object whose data will be displayed and manipulated within the Custom Related List component.

### Step 3: Field Selection
Upon selecting the related object, users can click the "Select Fields" button. This action triggers the display of all available fields associated with the selected object. Users can review and choose which fields they want to include in the displayed records.

### Step 4: Field Customization
To customize the displayed fields further, users can perform a right swipe on the fields they wish to include. This gesture adds the selected fields to the list of fields to be shown in the Custom Related List component.

### Step 5: Record Retrieval
Once the desired fields are selected, users can proceed by clicking the "OK" button. This action initiates the retrieval of records associated with the selected object, including only the specified fields. Users now have access to the relevant data within the Custom Related List component.

### Step 6: Search Functionality
To facilitate efficient data retrieval, users can utilize the search bar located on the right side of the component. This search bar enables users to filter and search for specific records based on predefined criteria, enhancing data exploration and analysis.

### Step 7: Record Creation
Adjacent to the search bar, users can find the "New" button. Clicking on this button allows users to create new records directly within the Custom Related List component, streamlining the record creation process for the selected object.

### Step 8: Record Operations
For each displayed record, users have access to a set of actions represented by action buttons. These actions typically include "Edit," "Delete," and "View." By clicking on these action buttons, users can perform respective operations on the associated record, such as editing its details, deleting it, or viewing its complete information.
